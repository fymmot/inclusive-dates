# Inclusive Dates datepicker
A human-friendly and fully accessible datepicker. Currently proof-of-concept, help me improve it!

## Main features
* Text input field that supports natural language processing through Chrono.js. You can type ```tomorrow```, ```"May fifteen"``` or ```"In 5 days"```! 
* Shortcut buttons make it easy to select most common dates.
* Calendar widget with full keyboard and screen reader support

## Other cool stuff
* Progressive enhancement - degrades gracefully when user does not have JavaScript or CSS
* On-demand help feature for screen reader and keyboard users
* Robust construction for screen readers. Does not rely on complex WAI-ARIA techniques. Has been user tested!
* Automated accessibility tests with aXe integrated in build process


## How to install
* Run ```npm install```
* Run ```gulp``` for build and watch
